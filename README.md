When run, this command line interface automatically generates a new [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and populates it with the changes made since the last release.

## Usage

Install the package from [npm](https://npmjs.com/release):

```bash
$ npm install -g release
```

Run this command inside your project's directory:

```bash
$ release
```

### Options

Simply run this command to get a list of all available options:

```bash
$ release -h
```

## Why?

As we at [ZEIT](https://github.com/zeit) moved all of our GitHub repositories from keeping a `HISTORY.md` file to using [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), we needed a way to automatically generate these releases from our own devices, rather than always having to open a page in the browser and manually add all commits titles to a certain version tag.

## Contributing

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Uninstall the package if it's already installed: `npm uninstall -g release`
3. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
4. You can now use `release` on the command line!

As always, you can use `npm test` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.
